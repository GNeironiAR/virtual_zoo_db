1. `virtualzoo_creation_script.sql`: SQL script to create the database schema
2. `virtual_zoo_sample_inserts.sql`: SQL script with sample data inserts
3. `virtual_zoo_query_sample.sql`: SQL script with example queries
4. `Virtual_Zoo_documentation.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the database structure and design
5. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): Visual representation of the database schema

## Database Overview

The Virtual Zoo database includes tables for:

- Species
- Habitats
- Feeding
- BreedingPrograms
- BirthRecords
- Visits
- Medications
- Treatments
- AnimalTreatments

These tables are interconnected to represent various aspects of zoo management, including animal care, habitat maintenance, breeding programs, medical treatments, and visitor interactions.

## Getting Started

To set up the database:

1. Run the `virtualzoo_creation_script.sql` to create the database schema.
2. Use the `virtual_zoo_sample_inserts.sql` to populate the database with sample data.
3. Refer to `virtual_zoo_query_sample.sql` for example queries to interact with the data.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive understanding of the database structure, relationships, and design decisions, please refer to the `Virtual_Zoo_documentation.pdf` file.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

The ERD provides a visual representation of the database tables and their relationships. It can be found in the repository as an image file.
